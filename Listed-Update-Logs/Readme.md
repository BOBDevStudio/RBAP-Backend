This directory holds files that tell the update logs dock what update logs it can display. If a version number is listed then the update log for that update will be available on the update logs dock.

Updates that mostly consist of bug fixes and minor/backend changes are usually not listed. If they were to be listed they would usually take up the one that's shown by default.
