When selected it gives the title system permission to pick which title it thinks you should have based on the priority of each title you have available. If you have none then it will show none but if you have at least one it will show which one has the highest priority. Due to a technical limitation when you select the auto option the title on your character will be removed but this only lasts until you respawn your character."
